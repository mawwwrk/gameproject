# gameproject
repo for SEI project 1

## Todos
- create canvas and movement system
- collision detection system
- spritesheet animation

# update 22nd Jan 2022

game is live on [github pages](https://mawwwrk.github.io/gameproject/).

at submission time, game is feature incomplete. There are no win/lose conditions, and collission doesn't work as it should.


things implemented:
    - robust sprite display system (which i probably spent more time i should have on)
    - state machine for player controls

things i wanted to include
    - character collision i.e. no phasing through things
    - inventory based progression
